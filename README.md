https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/

* ^ **ENABLE WEBHOOK MODE** before writing (because IFTTT doesnt work if not)
* ^ Copy and paste the code to visualize how the embed will look like!

- Please use the COMPACT line of code when applying into a IFTTT applet. (aka the whole code in 1 line)
- - IFTTT will show errors if this is not done even if the code is the same!

- Be aware that all of this code has the IFTTT modules!
